## General
Watch for double spaces which forces a line break.

I use line breaks in the raw markdown file just to make it easier to read. This doesn't make any difference to the way it's rendered. 

On my first kick at this project, over a year ago, I started adding DIV sections. When I was playing around with the markdown to PDF conversion the DIV sectioning allowed me to create special formatting with some CSS tricks. Iâ€™ve left them in on this reboot and will re-evaluate their usefulness shortly.

To format the text so it renders like the previous cards, use the following conventions. 

## Included in markdown
- Section header         					prepend with ## 
- Topic (bold)           					enclose in two asterisks **foo**
- Variable (italics)               			in *xxx*
- CLI commands (red & monospaced)  			enclose in backticks `code`
- URL linking (blue, underline)    			URL with http(s) 
**note**: shorten VMware's KB in this format: 	"https://kb.vmware.com/kb/123456"
- Comments (not shown in PDF)				<!-- comments --> 
- Line break (used before topic/sub-topic)	two space at end of line


## Needs HTML tags (no support in markdown)
- Underline (sub-topic)            			<u>  </u>
- Superscript                      			<super>  </super>
- File/folder location (green)     			<file>  </file>
- FIXME things (highlight)					<mark>  </mark>
- Section boxes 							<div class="section">  </div>

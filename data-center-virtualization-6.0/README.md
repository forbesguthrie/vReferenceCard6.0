**Work-in-progess**
Currently, much of the content in the 6.0 card sections relate to version 5.0 or 5.5 of the products as it's been brought over from previous card updates. Any help getting this updated with the 6.0 detail is very much appreciated.  Pull requests gladly accepted.   

Check out the TODO.md file for a running approximate progress of getting this updated to 6.0.

**note**: Initially we are targeting vSphere 6.0 GA products. Any differences with Update 1, 2, etc. should be noted in comments fields. These can be added in appropriately when it's collected.

# vReference Card collaboration hub
This project is a hub for the VMware community to obtain, review, update and create new vReference Cards. 

Currently the DCV version 6.0 is early work-in-progress. Once that has matured we can fork this off to start a 6.5 version and other cards.

## History
If you're not familiar with the vReference cards, you can a previous example here: http://www.vreference.com/vsphere-5-card/

The early cards were created with a variety of tools by Forbes Guthrie and published on his blog site, but the project has been migrated to GitHub to allow for wider colloboration and a much quicker update process.

## Card contents
The card contents are split into sections and created as markdown files which are easy to read and contain enough detail to create the vReference PDFs.

Here an easy Github Flavoured Markdown cheetsheet:

another good one to refer to:

The files can be edited in any text editor such as Github's own [Atom](https://atom.io/), or Microsoft's Visual Studio Code

## Converting to PDF
More instructions to follow

Many text editors can convert the markdown files to html and print as a basic PDF.

Future plan is to provide custom CSS which converts the markdown text and HTML tags and makes it look like a vReference card. Laterly, it's feasible to create slightly different CSS to produce A4, Letter and Full page versions.

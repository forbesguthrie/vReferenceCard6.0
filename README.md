# vReference Card collaboration hub
This project is a hub for the VMware community to obtain, review, update and create new vReference Cards. 

Currently the DCV version 6.0 is early work-in-progress. Once that has matured we can fork this off to start a 6.5 version and other cards.

## History
If you're not familiar with the vReference cards, you can a previous example here: http://www.vreference.com/vsphere-5-card/

used to use various tools to build This

want to make the process more open and collaborative

## Card contents
The card content in markdown files
link to something explaining markdown
example cheat sheets and GFM link

you can take this and use it as you like
very readabile in its current form

## converting to PDF
more instructions to follow, but for now
many text editors can convert the markdown files to html
you can render as html and print as PDF

future plan is to provide custom CSS which converts the markdown text and HTML tags and makes it look like a vReference card. Laterly, it's feasible to create slightly different CSS to produce  A4, Letter and Full page versions.
